		</p>

			<h2>Unit 2</h2>
			<p><img src="http://dailydropcap.com/images/D-4-cap.png" title="Daily Drop Cap by Jessica Hische" align="left" alt="D"/>uring this unit, I've actually learned a lot. Even though I learned some coding last year I didn't get it that well. But this year I really feel like I learned coding and I'm learning the tags well. During the unit, I learned how to make captions to a video, hyperlinks, making data tables, creating links, and much more. Web Design has been a fun experience as of far and I believe that I will get a lot better at coding through out the year. </p>
			<ul>
				<li>One thing I found very informational was adding captions to the video web page</li>
				<li>Another thing I found informational was when we created links and used hyperlinks</li>
				<li>The final thing I found informational was creating a data table</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h2>Unit 3</h2>
			<p> During unit 3, I got to learn about CSS. CSS is very important to web design as it changes the color and the margins and a lot more of your website. CSS really gives you the option to stylize your own website a lot. This unit taught me how CSS works, the typography of CSS, and overall using CSS. I'm excited to see where we go from here.</p>

			<h2>Unit 4</h2>
			<p>This unit taught me a lot about creating graphics and placing them on a wweb page. It kind of gave me a little refreshment on graphic design and using photoshop. i learned about scanning and how to create a web photo album. Later on through the unit, we learned more complicated things like creating a  banner and a button. Overall though, this unit was very informational and taught me a huge part of web design and that is the graphics.</p>

			<h2>Unit 5</h2>
			<p> During this unit, I really learned a lot about Javascript. It was one of the easiest units to me. I really understood Javascript at first, but I was absent for two class periods and that really left me behind. I did end up catching up with my work and I understand it again. I feel like the hardest part of the unit though was creating the form. The form was a little hard to make and took a bit to sketch out. Overall though I got through it and I really learned a lot about coding Javascript </p>

			<h2>Unit 6</h2>
			<p> During this unit, I learned a very important thing in web design and that's quality control. This unit I learned how to validate my web site and find errors in my code. It was really helpful learning how to validate my website. Also during this unit we had other students test our websites and see if it properly worked. This unit really gave me a lot of help and I was able to find and fix some errors. </p>
			<ul>
				<li>One thing I found informative from this unit was learning about validating websites to find errors in my code.</li>
				<li>Another thing I found informative about this unit was making a goodgle forms. I never made one before and I thought it was really cool.</li>
				<li>The final thing I found informative about this unit was having other people test my website. It is some experience for me as a web designer.

			<h2>Unit 7</h2>
			<p> This section will be completed soon</p>
