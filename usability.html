    <h1>Usability Study</h1>
    <h2> Method: I had other students look at and test my portfolio to see if it was working well. My target audience is really just my peers. My three tasks for the viewers were for them to click on a link in the navigation bar, press on my show alert butoon and see if it works, and to click on the size dropbox menu. </h2>
    <h2> Results: All four of the people that viewed my website succeeded in the tasks I gave them. The results were actually really good.</h2>
    <h2> Discussion: I learned that my website actually worked well, but it wasn't the most visually appealing. Most of the viewers felt that the colors on my website didn't work well. I'm going to try to make the web site look more appealing and professional. </h2>
